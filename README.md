## Build

Currently, CatFrida use frida-core 14.2.3. Since the binary file is too large, the git project doesn't include it. You can install it manually by the following steps:

1. Click to download [frida-core-devkit-14.2.3-macos-x86_64.tar.xz](https://github.com/frida/frida/releases/download/14.2.3/frida-core-devkit-14.2.3-macos-x86_64.tar.xz)

2. Extract `tar -xvf frida-core-devkit-14.2.3-macos-x86_64.tar.xz`

3. Copy `frida-core.h` and `libfrida-core.a` to `CatFrida/FridaBridge/CFrida/macos-x86_64/`

4. `pod install`

5. Open CatFrida.xcworkspace and build


## Scripts

CatFrida load script in `CatFrida/Scripts/_agent.js`. It was built by project [CatFridaAgent](https://github.com/neil-wu/CatFridaAgent). You can modify CatFridaAgent to add your own script.

Some script files are from [passionfruit](https://github.com/chaitin/passionfruit)

It also include my own project [FridaHookSwiftAlamofire](https://github.com/neil-wu/FridaHookSwiftAlamofire) to capture Alamofire HTTP requests.
